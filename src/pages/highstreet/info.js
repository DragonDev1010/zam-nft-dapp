      "The NFT game industry has a diversity of game genres from various publishers, each of them with their unique selling point and development plan. Therefore, Ftribe doesn't consider them as competition. They want to set themselves apart from other competitors by focusing on gameplay development and applying state of the art technology to their crafted environment. Another message portrayed here is the showcase of NFT games to the rest of the world. How this game distinguishes itself from other competitors: Console quality graphics made with the Unity engine. Ftribe Games Limited is a game studio in Vietnam, acquiring over 20 software engineers and digital artists from Gameloft. A free-to-play-to-earn model will allow users to make money through simply playing the game. No requirements needed! Compatible with any AR and VR devices currently available on the market (Oculus, HTC, etc.), the game will feature a NFT marketplace, gallery and social hub for players to interact with each other!",
